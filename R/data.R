#' @title Yeast protein localisations.
#'
#' @description A dataset containing the subcellular protein localisations along with
#' several amino acid sequence based metrics used to make a classification
#' of the localisation. `yeast` contains the full dataset while `yeast_classes` is
#' simply `class` collumn from the `yeast` dataset as a vector, for convenience
#' in the practical excercise.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 1484 rows and 10 variables:

#' @title Infectious disease outbreaks in the USA, data from the CDC
#'
#' @description This dataset provides data on foodborne disease outbreaks reported to CDC from 1998 
#' through 2015. Data fields include year, state (outbreaks occurring in more than one state are listed
#' as "multistate"), location where the food was prepared, reported food vehicle and contaminated 
#' ingredient, etiology (the pathogen, toxin, or chemical that caused the illnesses), status (whether 
#' the etiology was confirmed or suspected), total illnesses, hospitalizations, and fatalities. 
#' In many outbreak investigations, a specific food vehicle is not identified; for these outbreaks, 
#' the food vehicle variable is blank.
